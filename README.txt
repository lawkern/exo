exo is a work-in-progress exokernel-style operating system.

/src/compiler - a compiler for a simple C-like systems programming language
/src/desktop - a desktop environment and GUI library
/src/kernel - the actual kernel
/data - general collection of assets

The top-level Makefile can be used to build each section of the project by name.

Be warned! None of this code does anything productive yet. Enjoy!
